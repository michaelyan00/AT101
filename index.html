        <p>The <span class ="noun">Victorian</span> <span class = "noun3">government</span> will not apply for exemptions for unvaccinated players <span class ="noun2">travelling</span> from overseas to appear at next year’s <span class ="noun">Australian</span> Open, the state’s premier has <span class ="noun4">said.</span></p>

        <p>“I want to be very clear with every <span class ="noun">Victorian</span>, my government won’t be <span class ="noun2">applying</span> for an exemption for any unvaccinated player,” Andrews <span class ="noun4">said</span>.</p>

        <p>“I am not going to ask and require people <span class ="noun2">sitting</span> in the grandstand, people working at the event to be vaccinated while players aren’t. We’re not going to be applying an exemption. Therefore the issue is basically <span class = "noun5">resolved</span>.”</p>

        <p>Earlier, Australia’s <span class = "noun3">prime minister</span>, Scott Morrison, had indicated those athletes who have not taken a Covid vaccine would still be allowed into the country for the season’s opening grand slam, as long as they undertook two weeks of quarantine<span class = "noun6"></span>.</p>
