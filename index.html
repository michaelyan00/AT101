        <p>The <span class ="noun">Victorian</span> government will not apply for exemptions for unvaccinated players <span class =".noun2">travelling</span> from overseas to appear at next year’s <span class ="noun">Australian</span> Open, the state’s premier has said.</p>
        <p>“I want to be very clear with every <span class ="noun">Victorian</span>, my government won’t be applying for an exemption for any unvaccinated player,” Andrews said.</p>
        <p>“I am not going to ask and require people sitting in the grandstand, people working at the event to be vaccinated while players aren’t. We’re not going to be applying an exemption. Therefore the issue is basically resolved.”</p>
        <p>Earlier, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, had indicated those athletes who have not taken a Covid vaccine would still be allowed into the country for the season’s opening grand slam, as long as they undertook two weeks of quarantine.</p>
